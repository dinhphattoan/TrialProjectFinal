Experience-Based Breakage: A measure, taken on a monthly basis, of the actual breakage for the portfolio, computed as a fraction, with the numerator being the total forecasted unredeemed amounts of all cards in the Card portfolio and the denominator being the total loads of the card portfolio. The purpose of this measure is to provide a short-term red-flag metric regarding the actual breakage performance of the portfolio.
Forecasting Accuracy: A measure, computed quarterly, of the forecasted breakage versus the actual breakage, per parameters set by Card Compliant.
Forecasted Earnings: The amount of earnings from all cards in the portfolio that is expected to be derecognized in future months. Life-to-Date Fee Transactions: The total amount of fees taken on the cards in a fee portfolio through the as-of date, expressed as a positive value.
Materiality of Excess Earnings: The measures of Excess Earnings as (i) a percent of total forecasted breakage and (ii) a percent of the remaining card balance of card payables in a card portfolio.
Revolving Excess Earnings Reserve: The measures showing (i) the percentage of breakage to be withheld from income recognition per Client, and (ii) the dollar amount which is currently being reserved from income recognition.
SDB Month: The month of age used to define Slope-Determined Breakage.
Slated for Escheat: The part of the total card payable balance that is expected, as of the report date, to escheat to a State on the applicable Escheat Filing dates unless some future event changes its status prior to escheat.
Slated for Non-Escheat: The part of the total card payable balance that is not expected, as of the Report date, to escheat to any State unless some future event changes its escheat status.
Slope-Determined Breakage: A measure of breakage showing, for practical purposes, the amount of breakage that can be expected, using the balance as a percent of load, when the balance almost completely stops decreasing over time. Defined as the estimated percent balance for the month of age when the month-to-month decrease in redemption is less than a specified parameter. Stale Card Recapture Rate â€“ Current Month: A measure in an applicable month of the amount of redemptions which occurred on cards which have passed their Amortization Period.
Tax Deferral Period: The number of fiscal years, as set by Client, by which stated earnings can be delayed for tax purposes. The current choices for deferral are none, one year, or two years.
Terminal Breakage: A measure of breakage that is the forecasted percentage of the card loads that likely will not be redeemed subject to standard deviations, which measure is determined as the asymptotic limit of the estimated balance by month of age as the age gets statistically large.
